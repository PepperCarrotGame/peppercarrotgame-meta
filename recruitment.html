			<p>Hello there, we have been working on a game based on David Revoy's open source comic <a href="http://peppercarrot.com/">Pepper & Carrot</a> for the last few months, we have a stablished story and game mechanics and <strong>we are currently looking for an artist</strong> to join us with the development of the title, we have a team of three versatile programmers and a composer for the music.</p>
			
			<p>The game is a 2D side-scrolling RPG game that narrates the epic quest of Pepper and company to restore order in their world after the misterious disappearance of all their beloved pets, soon they 
will know the motives behind such strange events and they will embark in a mission not only to save their pets, but to save their homeworld, Hereva..</p>
			
			<p>As an illustrator you would help create the world's environment, the game's art style and the appeareance of the characters.</p>
			
			<p>We are team that loves videogames and we want to transmit that passion to players, we believe that how good a game is depends on how much love is put into it.</p>

			<p>At this time most of the planning for the game is done, and some in-engine work has been done.</p>
			
			<p>If you are interested or want to ask us any question we can be reached at the following places:</p>
